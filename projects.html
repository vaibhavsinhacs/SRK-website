           Guidance system acts as the brain of aerospace vehicles, and success of mission relies heavily on the performance 
of guidance system. In the early days, achieving target interception with zero miss distance has been the primary focus
          of guidance design for many years. In recent days, optimizing energy usage and achieving terminal constraints are 
          some of the additional constraints, which are of paramount improtance. Terminal constaints such as impact angle 
          increases the warhead effectivenss while the impact time helps in saturating the target defense system and 
          thus increasing the survivability of interceptor. This project focuses on designing guidance and control of autonomous 
          aerial vehicles for acheiving terminal as well as in-flight constraints. The terminal constraints include target interception at a 
           particular impact time or interception from a pre-sepcified orientation, while the in-flight constraints accounts for
            field-of-view (FOV) constraints which helps to keep the target in view during engagement. This project aims to design both two-loop as well as integrated design of guidance and control to achieve the objectives. 
           Guidance design must account for the variations in vehicle dynamics subject to the thrust and aerodynamic parameter 
           variations. Owing to the nature of engagement duration, the developed guidance strategies should respect the finite 
           time convergence of controlled variables.

            This project is about the design of cooperative guidance strategy for several 
            vehicles to achieve simultaneous interception of the target. Modern targets are 
            becoming technologically advanced which imposes several challenges for vehicles 
            to complete their mission. Simultaneous interception by weaker adversaries against 
            a stronger one are effective. This project aims to design cooperative salvo guidance 
            strategy using finite and fixed-time consensus in coordination variables. This 
            project will also attempt to develop cooperative salvo guidance, against various 
            targets, at a time either pre-specified or decided online. Guidance philosophy 
            would be based merging the concepts of consensus in multi-agent systems and nonlinear 
            control techniques to cater for the communication capability of vehicles, along with 
            the robustness against the erroneous measurements/estimation of data and uncertainties.

            Gas turbine engine is a key component for aerial vehicles. The performance of  engine plays a vital role 
            in the success of mission. The project aims to design an integrated robust fault diagnosis and isolation 
            (FDI), and fault-tolerant control (FTC) system for gas turbine/jet engine in different fault scenarios. 
            The main objective of fault-tolerant control is to maintain the specified performance of a system in the 
            presence of faults. With the increasing demand on reliability and safety in gas turbine/jet engines, 
            which are prone to components faults and operational abnormalities, it is extremely important to detect 
            and diagnose potential faults and abnormalities as early as possible, and implement fault-tolerant control 
            to minimize performance degradation and avoid dangerous accidents. Advanced FTC schemes are required to 
            ensure efficient and reliable operation of complex technological systems. Fault detection and isolation 
            forms a vital part of any integrated active fault-tolerant system. The development of mathematical models 
            of engine, actuators, and sensors will be required for designing FDD and FTC system design. The model 
            development is proposed to be done using system identification and/or computational techniques.
